--  Colour schemes/themes and look/feel a bit unprofessional
    --  Could model after their business site (http://halifaxchamber.com/)?
        --  They have "MENU" (caps) right-aligned (not left)
        --  Use more similar font-face?
--  Design on "Membership data entry" page collapses for smaller resolutions (width < 448px)
--  Membership data entry page doesn't have the menu at the top left, feels a bit inconsistent
--  Interaction inconsistency of Pop-up vs page/mode: some sub-menus bring up pop-ups but some just opens pages


To follow up on the colour schemes/theme point, you can define a new theme (colours, fonts, button styles, etc) for 
jQuery Mobile using the ThemeRoller: https://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/. 
Instructions on how to use it are available here: https://learn.jquery.com/jquery-mobile/theme-roller/.
